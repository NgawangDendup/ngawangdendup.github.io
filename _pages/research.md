Research Interest
=================

- Environmental Economics
- Development Economics
- Energy Economics
- Applied Microeconometrics

My research involves trying to understand the interactions between environment and economic development. In partciular, my research involves application of applied microeconometrics in the field of Environment, Development and Energy Economics. Environment, energy and development issues in developing countries are closely connected and my research aims at understanding how economic agents responds to incentives, policy interventions, different price mechanism and role of technology. My research areas covers wide range of topics in economics of environment, energy and development including electricity, dynamics of fossil fuel, pollution, water, sanitation and infrastructure. I also recently started collaboration on similar issues in developed countries. 

Work-in-Progress

1. Nonlinear electricity pice and subsidy in developing countries. 
2. Impacts of Solar Subsidy:Evidence from Geographic Regression Discontinuity Design in Nepal

4. Intrahousehold time allocation and biogas in Nepal
(Details will be updated later)
