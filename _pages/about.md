I am a Assistant Professor of Economics (without-tenure-track) in the Faculty of Political Science and Economics, [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). I completed PhD from the [Graduate School of Economics](https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/gse/en/) from same [University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/) in June 2019. My research interest includes environment, development and energy economics.  In my research, I use the tools of applied microeconometrics.  

I am currently working on electricity pricing issues in developing countries. In particular, I am trying to understand how household response to nonlinear electricity pricing and subsidy using monthly electricity data. 

If you are a student and interested in the courses I teach but not sure if it is right course for you, feel free to write to me.
