Thank you for visiting my page.

My name is Ngawang Dendup, and I work as a Consultant/Economist at the Asian Development Bank Institute ([ADBI](https://www.adb.org/adbi/main)). Before joining ADBI, I was an Assistant Professor (without tenure) at the Faculty of Political Science and Economics, Waseda University.

I conduct research in the field of applied microeconomics, focusing on energy, environment, and development economics. In my recent research, I employ a combination of applied microeconometrics and model-based approaches.

I am also a visiting researcher at the Waseda Institute for Advanced Studies ([WIAS](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/wias/en/)) and the Research Institute for Management and Environmental Economics ([RIEEM](https://prj-rieem.w.waseda.jp/en/)).
