My name is Ngawang Dendup, and I work as a Consultant/Economist at the [Asian Development Bank Institute](https://www.adb.org/adbi/main) (ADBI). Before joining ADBI, I was an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Political Science and Economics, Waseda University.

I conduct research in the field of applied microeconomics, focusing on energy, environment, and development economics. In my recent research, I employ a combination of applied microeconometrics and model-based approaches.

I am also a visiting researcher at the [Waseda Institute for Advanced Studies](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/wias/en/) (WIAS) and the [Research Institute for Management and Environmental Economics](https://prj-rieem.w.waseda.jp/en/) (RIEEM).
