Thank you for visiting my page.

My name is Ngawang Dendup, and I work as a Consultant/Economist at the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI). Before joining (ADBI)[], I was an Assistant Professor (without tenure) at the Faculty of Political Science and Economics, Waseda University.

I conduct research in the field of applied microeconomics, focusing on energy, environment, and development economics. In my recent research, I employ a combination of applied microeconometrics and model-based approaches.
